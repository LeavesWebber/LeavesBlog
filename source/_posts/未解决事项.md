试图使用systemd服务设置开机自启动应用时，已经写好.service文件，试图更新配置文件时报错
``` bash
root@ubuntuMC1:/etc/systemd/system# systemctl daemon-reload
System has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.

# 关于rc*.d文件的困惑
这个问题在我试图设置开机自启动应用时遇到了

如上图所示，我的etc文件夹内的rc*.d十分奇怪。

# Cron的启动运行悖论
crontab里的@reboot规则需要依赖于cron service才能运行

但是开机状态下cron service并不能运行
